# CardanoSharpTxBuilderDemo
Demo app for building transactions using CardanoSharp Wallet &amp; Blazor Components

 - Currently everything goes great until Line 52 of Index.razor - there, the wallet opens up for signing, but  the transaction preview is missing and/or there is an error message from the wallet: "Inputs do not conform to this spec or are otherwise invalid."
